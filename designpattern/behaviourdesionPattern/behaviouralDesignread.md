ðŸ§  In Interviews, Focus On:
Emphasis	Notes

Strategy vs State vs Template	Often compared; understanding the subtle difference is key
Observer	Event-driven design is very popular
Chain of Responsibility	Very common in filter chains & clean error handling
Command	Excellent for "undo" and job control logic questions
Visitor	More often seen in complex problems (compilers, trees), less in CRUD apps

ðŸš€ In Production (Spring / Java Projects)
Strategy Pattern â€“ payment types, encryption algorithms, Spring @Qualifier or @Primary

Observer Pattern â€“ ApplicationListener, Kafka consumers, async events

Chain of Responsibility â€“ OncePerRequestFilter, Spring Security chains

Template Method â€“ JDBC Template, RestTemplate, common test setups

Command Pattern â€“ Schedulers (Quartz), job runners

State Pattern â€“ Order status flow, finite-state machines

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation
If you're preparing for interviews or want to build production-ready systems, focus on:

âœ… Strategy, Observer, Chain of Responsibility, Template Method, Command, and State.
