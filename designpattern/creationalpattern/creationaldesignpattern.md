### ğŸ§© **Creational Design Patterns â€“ One-Liner Cheat Sheet**

1. **Singleton**
   ğŸ‘‰ Ensures a class has only **one instance** and provides a **global access point** to it.

2. **Factory Method**
   ğŸ‘‰ Lets subclasses **decide which class to instantiate** by defining a common interface for object creation.

3. **Abstract Factory**
   ğŸ‘‰ Provides an interface to **create families of related objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

4. **Builder**
   ğŸ‘‰ Separates the **construction of a complex object** from its representation so the same process can create different results.

5. **Prototype**
   ğŸ‘‰ Creates new objects by **cloning existing ones**, instead of creating from scratch.
